## Lab00 - Algorithm Runtime Experimentation 
### Daniel Gelfand, Tabassum Fabiha, Shayan Chowdhurry


Hypothesis: The correlation between n and runtime will represent a linear relationship.

Background: As the length of an array changes, the time to execute an algorithm that finds a given value in the array increases. This experiment explores the relationship between the length of the array(independent variable) and the runtime to find the true Big-O representation.
